# Tutorials

Our tutorials offer **hands-on, interactive examples** that demonstrate how to effectively leverage the library. 
Each tutorial is presented in a **notebook format**, providing you with step-by-step guidance on the key features 
of {{webpm-client}}.

Every tutorial centers on the core functionality of the **<api-link target='install'></api-link>** method, 
offering practical examples to help you integrate and use the library efficiently. Explore topics such as:

- **[ESM Modules](@nav/tutorials/esm):** Learn how to install and utilize ECMAScript Modules (ESM) in your project.
- **[Pyodide](@nav/tutorials/pyodide):** Discover how to set up a Python runtime in your browser and install Python modules seamlessly.
- **[Backends](@nav/tutorials/backends):** Explore deploying backend microservices using the **W3Nest** solution.
- **[Web Workers](@nav/tutorials/web-workers):** Master managing worker pools to offload heavy computations and boost performance.

<note level="hint" title="Hints">
- Many **API links** are integrated throughout the tutorials (e.g., <api-link target='install'></api-link>). 
  For an enhanced viewing experience on larger screens, toggle a **split view** using this button:
  <split-api></split-api> (also accessible from the navigation side-panel).

- The notebook format, provided by <ext-link target="mkdocs-ts">mkdocs-ts</ext-link>, exemplifies a typical need
  for on-the-fly installation because dependencies can only be resolved at runtime.
