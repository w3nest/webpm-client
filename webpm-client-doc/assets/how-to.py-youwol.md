# Py-YouWol

Py-YouWol provides an emulated cloud environment on your PC, combining the flexibility of a local setup with 
the convenience of cloud-like accessibility.

## Objectives

*  **Cloud Accessibility:** Run applications directly in your web browser, with any missing components automatically 
installed.
*  **PC Customizability:** Deploy and configure software locally at run time, allowing for a tailored and elastic 
environment.

Running executable locally also provides advantages regarding security and performance.

Last but not least, operating on the PC facilitates seamless integration with other local tools and applications, 
enhancing workflows. Users can easily link their development environments, data analysis tools, and other software 
directly, creating a cohesive and efficient work setup.
