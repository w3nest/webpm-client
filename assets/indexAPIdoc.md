The **webpm-client** library provides a powerful and flexible way to manage and install components in both the main
thread and Web Workers.

*  The primary entry point is {@link MainModule}, which serves as the core module for installing components in the main 
   thread.

*  The {@link WorkersPoolModule} extends functionality by enabling component installation in Web Workers, as well as 
  task execution and monitoring.

into your project.
